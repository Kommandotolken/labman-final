### Created by Henrik Thomasson, Software Engineering 2018 at BTH.


The "main" js files are located in the root of labman-master

The sql folder contains everything related to the database

#The config folder contains a json file that is used when connecting to the database.

The public folder is used for CSS files and things related to that.

The views folder is split into two subfolders. There is an "English" and "svenska" folder, these are used when switching between languages.
